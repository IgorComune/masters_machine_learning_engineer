# Progression in the Machine Learning Engineering Course

In this repository, I will document my entire journey through the **Machine Learning Engineering** course by FIAP+Alura. The course is divided into five key phases:

## Course Phases

### Phase 1: ML Fundamentals
Introduction to AI and Machine Learning concepts, with hands-on experience in Python and cloud-based ML solutions.

### Phase 2: Big Data Architecture
Exploring data storage structures, Big Data platforms, and relational and non-relational databases.

### Phase 3: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
Training classification, regression models, and techniques like clustering and dimensionality reduction.

### Phase 4: Deep Learning and AI
Focus on neural networks, NLP, computer vision, and generative AI, including GANs and LLMs.

### Phase 5: MLOps
Deploying models, CI/CD, monitoring, and managing models in production.

Follow my notes and practical projects through each phase.
